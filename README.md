# Project Alterna-Canvas

This project was created by Yale Miller, Josh McKettrick, and Bao Huynh.

## Project Summary and Descripion
We were required to implement a new, improvized Canvas application. Canvas is the current application that the University of Cincinnati uses to post class assignments, grades, and related class materials. Many students have complaints with our current Canvas system, so we were tasked to take our critisims and implement them in a reimagined system. We also were tasked to make Canvas more fun and interactive by adding a game-like feature to it. Below are some guidelines to how our application was designed.
- Users should be able to select their own profile.
- Users should be enrolled in three courses with fully implemented course materials:
   - User Interface
   - Senior Design
   - Computer Graphics
- Users should be able to do the following for each of the courses listed above:
   - View and submit current assignments.
   - View learning modules with course materials.
   - Plan their current assignments.
   - Access a Zoom classroom link.
   - View their course Syllabus.
   - Have visual indications that change when tasks are completed. Example: Submit assignment button should be unavailable after a student has already submitted the assignment.
- Application should reflect a user's progress as if they are halfway complete with the semester.
   - There should be grades for past assignments, learning modules that have passed, etc. This will allow us to show our application's full functionality.
